python3-ipfs-api is a complete rewrite of [python-ipfs-api](https://github.com/ipfs/python-ipfs-api).
It defines a whole new interface and tries to do more than just wrapping the
HTTP API. python3-ipfs-api will only support Python 3 (hence the name).

python3-ipfs-api uses [requests](http://python-requests.org) to issue API
calls. Also it has a minimal implementation of a protobuf reader/writer for
using protobuf encoding where possible. This makes it possible to e.g. put/get
objects with binary content without a problem.

In ipfs.api you'll find the lowlevel API implementation. The high-level API is
still work in progess and only consists of the ifps.merkledag module at the moment. An
API for interfacing unixfs in a pythonic way will come soon.
